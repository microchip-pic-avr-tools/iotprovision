How to build an executable
--------------------------

1: Create an empty folder for your project, for example: iotprovision_exe

2: Go to the root of the new directory and install all packages/dependencies 
   pip3 install iotprovision -t ./ -U

3: Run pyinstaller (needs to be installed with pip or similar first)
   pyinstaller ./iotprovision-bin-all.spec --clean

4: The exe file will be in the dist folder, dist/iotprovision-bin[.exe]
